# From Zero to Fully Operational Developer Platform in 5 Steps!

## Description

Internal Developer Platforms or IDPs are **not hard to create**. Anyone can do it, as long as that someone knows **everything about everything**.

Today I'll show you **everything** you should know **about developer platforms**. We'll go through all the principles behind them, through all the components they should have, and I'll even show you how to build one. This will be a tutorial on how to build a platform in **5 mandatory and 1 optional step**.

At the end of today's journey, you'll have a **fully operational IDP** with everything you might need. Most likely...

We'll have only one requirement before we embark on the journey. Everything needs to be open source. When possible, projects we'll use should be in a foundation like CNCF or CDF or any other. If that is not possible or not practical, we might resort to a non Open Source solution but, if that happens, it needs to be at least free.

So, the only rule is that it should be **open source**, preferably in a **foundation**, or **free**.

During the talk, we'll see a tool used for each of the categories but I will give you the alternative solutions that should produce a similar result. So, you should be able to switch those I used if, for some reason or another, my choice does not fit your needs.

There are, ofcouse, objectives as well. Actually, there is only one objective. We'll create a platform that will do everything that needs to be done related to applications. Now, when I say applications, I mean everything required to deploy and observe applications. That means **Git repositories**, **manifests**, **scripts**, **workflows**, **databases**, **policies**, and anything else that we might need.

Finally, everything we'll do today will be, more or less, easy. The challenge is not necessarily in learning specific tools but, rather, in making the right choices and knowing how to combine them.
