# The Past, the Present, and the Future of Platform Engineering

## Description

Do you think platform engineering is too hard? Or is it just a buzzword? Is the CNCF landscape too tricky to visualize? If you've been in this industry long enough, you should know that platform engineering has been around for a long time.

Most of us have been trying to build developer platforms for decades, and most of us have failed at that. That begs the questions: "What is different now?" "Why will this time be different?" and "Do we have a chance to succeed?"

We'll take a look at the past, the present, and the future of platform engineering. We'll see what we were doing in the past, what we did wrong, and why we failed. Further on, we'll see what we (the industry as a whole) are doing now and, more importantly, where we might go from here.

Get ready for the hard truths and challenges you will face when trying to build a platform based on Kubernetes. Join us for a pain-infused journey filled with challenges teams will face when building platforms to enable other teams.
