Note:
It starts on your laptop ends in production.
Implementation detail (for those not specialized in Kubernetes)
It's not about teaching people Kubernetes as-is but about making Kubernetes developer friendly (through higher-level abstractions).
Docker was designed to be developer friendly, but failed at low-level (TODO: Diagram).
Kubernetes started from low-level and extensibility which sucks at user-experience (TODO: Diagram).
Major difference is that there will be no single developer-friendly Kubernetes. There will be a way to create or choose a distribution that makes it dev-friendly (CNOE / BACK stack / OpenShift).
Emergence of distributions that solve specific problems (e.g., batch processing with Kueue, CPs with KCP, multi-cluster something, etc.)

Envoy AI Gateway / Dapr Conversation API for LLMs
We use AI / LLMs to refine how platform teams adopt new technologies and solve integration problems
We help developers in their application modernization journey by providing LLMs as a platform capability
