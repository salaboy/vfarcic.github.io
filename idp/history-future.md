# The Future

Note: 
I am super hyped about these two certifications, as this highlights that we are maturing as an industry. Companies adopting Platform as a Product mindset are experiencing improvements on IT operational efficiency, developer productivity and ... 


### Do we need to hide Kubernetes from Developers?

Note:
It starts on your laptop ends in production.
Implementation detail (for those not specialized in Kubernetes)
It's not about teaching people Kubernetes as-is but about making Kubernetes developer friendly (through higher-level abstractions).
Docker was designed to be developer friendly, but failed at low-level (TODO: Diagram).
Kubernetes started from low-level and extensibility which sucks at user-experience (TODO: Diagram).
Major difference is that there will be no single developer-friendly Kubernetes. There will be a way to create or choose a distribution that makes it dev-friendly (CNOE / BACK stack / OpenShift).

Note:
Mauricio: we are not going to hide Kubernetes, but the main responsability for platform engineers should be to isolate developers from the complexities of Kubernetes


### Multi cluster specialized tools

- Kueue
- KCP
- Karpor

<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/karpor.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

Note: 
We expect to see more of these tools
Emergence of distributions that solve specific problems (e.g., batch processing with Kueue, CPs with KCP, multi-cluster something, etc.)

Note: 
AI is here to stay, how does this affect our platform initiatives. 


### AI as a platform capability

## Cloud native platforms are not built in isolation. We need to help each other to mature our Platform Engineering practices.

Note: 
And that includes
- More open source blueprints & reference architectures
- Developers and Platform Engineers talk to each other
- We use AI to improve our platform engineering skills
