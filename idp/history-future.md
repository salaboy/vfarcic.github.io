# The Future

Note: 
I am super hyped about these two certifications, as this highlights that we are maturing as an industry. Companies adopting Platform as a Product mindset are experiencing improvements on IT operational efficiency, developer productivity and ... 


### Do we need to hide Kubernetes from Developers?

Note:
It starts on your laptop ends in production.
Implementation detail (for those not specialized in Kubernetes)
It's not about teaching people Kubernetes as-is but about making Kubernetes developer friendly (through higher-level abstractions).
Docker was designed to be developer friendly, but failed at low-level (TODO: Diagram).
Kubernetes started from low-level and extensibility which sucks at user-experience (TODO: Diagram).
Major difference is that there will be no single developer-friendly Kubernetes. There will be a way to create or choose a distribution that makes it dev-friendly (CNOE / BACK stack / OpenShift).

Note:
Mauricio: we are not going to hide Kubernetes, but the main responsability for platform engineers should be to isolate developers from the complexities of Kubernetes


### Multi cluster specialized tools

- KCP
- Kueue
- 

Note: 
Emergence of distributions that solve specific problems (e.g., batch processing with Kueue, CPs with KCP, multi-cluster something, etc.)

Note: 
AI is here to stay, how does this affect our platform initiatives. 


### AI as a platform capability

### Wish list

- I wish that we can bring developer communities close to learn more about the challanges that they face and how platform teams can help them to do better
- I wish that we use AI to improve our platform engineering skills, leveraging unification of platform cross-cutting concerns to enhance our AI initiatives
- I wish to see more companies building and maturing blueprints to people starting with their paltform engineering journeys can get up to speed
