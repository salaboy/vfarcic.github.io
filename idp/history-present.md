Note:
Mauricio:
In 2018, I jumped to work with the Knative team at VMware, after almost 3 years of working full time helping developers and teams to adopt Kubernetes-based projects I realized that working with Go for this ecosystem made a lot of sense, but at the same time by 2020, the cloud native community was much more than Go. Communities like Java, dotnet, Python, and Node were getting closer to the Kubernetes ecosystem.

Note:
Mauricio:
This journey led me back to developers, when in Nov 2022 I joind Diagrid a company working on the Dapr project. Same story again, cloud native project, written in Go but aiming to provide developers using any language APIs to abstract away the complexities of creating and running distributed applications. 

Not a platform (alone)

Note:
A diagram with Backstage, Argo CD, Crossplane, Dapr, etc. that a) demonstrate how Kubernetes components can work together and b) showcases one possible IDP.
Kubernetes is too complicated for anyone to be exposed to it directly (unless SME)
Neither Dapr, Crossplane, Knative, Argo CD, Backstage or AI will make Kubernetes transparent.
But we, as platform engineers, are getting really comfortable at combining these tools.
Mauricio:
In Feb of 2020, I started writing the book published in Oct 2023 titled Platform Engineering on Kubernetes, this book was all about Kubernetes-based projects and the natural adoption journey for all these tools. I had a very ambitious goal, I wanted to make this book about software delivery, hence I needed a complex application (not a hello world) to show how the cloud native ecosystem can help companies to deliver software, but letâ€™s be clear, if you are in KubeCon you are closer to DevOps and infrastructure, not application development.

# Blueprints


# BACK Stack

Note:
We have seen a lot of consolidation happening in the space, with tools blueprints like CNOE, BACK Stack and Kusion stack building combinations of tools.
This shows maturity around projects that are now integrated with one another and presented in common use cases.
