Note:
A diagram with Backstage, Argo CD, Crossplane, Dapr, etc. that a) demonstrate how Kubernetes components can work together and b) showcases one possible IDP.
Kubernetes is too complicated for anyone to be exposed to it directly (unless SME)
Neither Dapr, Crossplane, Knative, Argo CD, Backstage or AI will make Kubernetes transparent.
But we, as platform engineers, are getting really comfortable at combining these tools.
