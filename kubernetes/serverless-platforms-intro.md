## What Do We Want?

## Serverless experience

* Here's source code, build it and run it
* Scale it up and down
* Don't ask me unnecessary questions
* Make it simple


### This experience is not available out-of-the-box in Kubernetes

* We need autoscalers
* We need a way to build from source to container
* We need to define the kind of Serverless experience we want
* We need a way to connect functions and infrastructure


## OpenFunction

* We looked at OpenFunctions 
* https://openfunction.dev
